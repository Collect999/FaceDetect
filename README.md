# Demo/MVP to detect facial gestures

- MVP for us to integrate into any other swift app
- Calibration phrase which looks at the face
- Count down- then detect most significantly changed facial gesture

Plan

- After detection - show table, then choose gesture, show facial gesture movement on screen 
- Add threshold slider
- Add ability to comine gestures eg "blink either eye" (not just left or right)
  
- Allow for detection of multiple gestures

Issues

Its slow - and thats because we are showing the wrong type of camera view. We need a regular camera view - not ACSN view
